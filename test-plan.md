# QIT #

- MVP Test Plan 1.12
- Versioned for Core User Experience 1.0; produced on 4 February, 2019
- Plan produced by Arlene Andrews (@ArleneAndrews)
- Modification to include more test activity

## Introduction ##
This is a master-level plan to insure that all of the areas of the QIT Core User Experience have unit and end-to-end tests. With many active and not always consistent improvements, this plan will assure that all the important areas have unit tests, and that both **online** and **offline** **end-to-end** tests are created, maintained and checked on a regular basis.

Having these tests in place will give a head-start of the final product, building on the work done at this level. 

Being hosed on **GitHub**, this plan will be able to be updated as requirements change, and as tests and features are added.

Using the **linter, Netlify**'s process and **Jenkins**, plus manual review of the proposed changes to the plan will ensure that this is standardized, current, up-to-date, and valuable to all users.


## Environmental Needs ##
As this is a **Progressive Web Application** (PWA), the environmental needs are minimal, but without them, the tests and application cannot be run. If there are terms used in an unfamiliar manner, please consult the Glossary to insure that the working vocabulary is consistent.

Hardware:

- A Windows computer **or** a 2010 or newer Macintosh

  - Chosen hardware should be capable of running a 64 bit [operating system](https://github.com/codingblocks/qit.cloud/wiki/glossary#operating-system) and have a minimum of 500**MB** free hard drive space
  - Specific requirements for the major **operating system**s are listed on the [Docker CE page](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)
- Stable internet connection of 600 **Kbps** download or faster
- Reliable source of power
- Monitor (800 x 600 providing 32 color display or higher)
- Keyboard
- Mouse


Software:

- Preferred **operating system** installed and functional
- **Browser** [capable of running service workers](https://vaadin.com/pwa/learn/browser-support)
- **IDE** that has a **terminal** and is capable of interacting with **GitHub**
- Either:
   - The current version of [Docker](https://github.com/codingblocks/qit.cloud/wiki/glossary#docker) **OR**
   - The current versions of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Data:

- The podcast has a **search engine** installed, for live tests.
- There is data in `/cypress/fixtures` that is used for mocking API calls and audio check.
- User stories that are in a separate file, and at the moment unwritten.



## Test Items ##

Both of these test suites should run in **online** and **offline** mode; there are some obvious things that will fail, and should have a graceful **fallback** (such as downloading a new pod cast while offline).

A check box has been added to indicate if a test in in place [x], in the process of being written [?], or needs to be added [ ]. Keeping this up-to-date will ensure that duplicate tests in the same level are not created.

This will also allow us to have a better grasp on what the [Code Coverage](https://github.com/codingblocks/qit.cloud/issues/110) **badge** actually means for the vital areas. 

After speaking with others in the project, this section may undergo a major revision, once all test areas are identified, and the overall goals for each area updated.

###Unit tests:###

## Test We WANT to Fail ##
There are people out there who wish to use or abuse content created by others, including personal information and secure inputs. These test will be written as if someone is trying to get additional information, which is why we want them to fail. 
This feels, to me, a more straightforward approach than figuring out the negative cases, and writing them that way.
The first test is an example - we don't want someone able to input a command in the user name field. The fact that it will not run the code is a passing test.

[ ]  I can add code in the user name field  
[ ]  I can add code in the password field  
[ ]  I can add in the email field  
[ ]  I can find the password of accounts other than QIT  
[ ]  I can open other apps on the mobile device  
[ ]  I can open other desktop apps  
[ ]  I can send mail to other contacts by using QIT  
[ ]  I can access user information without being signed in  
[ ]  I can use an app to request money from a bank  
[ ]  I can use an app to request money from a social contact  
[ ]  I can download and modify a podcast episode  
[ ]  I can upload a changed episode  
[ ]  Docker containers can be pulled up or shut down from inside QIT  
[ ]  Code can be added to be run during opening/shutdown  
[ ]  I can access a different database  
[ ]  The API can be pointed at a different location  
[ ]  Contacts can be opened and an email sent  
[ ]  Contacts can be copied  
[ ]  Other apps can be opened and used, without being shown on-screen

[ ]  Shared lists can be changed to add a backdoor  
[ ]  Shared lists can have additional code added to them   

##Features Not To Be Tested##

This section needs a redesign, to allow room to place the reason why these items are not yet tested: such as a feature that has been used before and has not yet caused problems, or one that is not in this release. All of these tests and checks need to be looked at from the USERS point of view, and fail or pass on that criteria.

This list is incomplete, and needs additions to it.

# TODO #

##Approach##

·  What metrics will be collected?
·  Which level is each metric to be collected at?
·  How is Configuration Management to be handled?
·  How many different configurations will be tested
·  Hardware
·  Software
·  What are the regression test rules? How much will be done and how much at each test
level.
·  Will regression testing be based on severity of defects detected?
·  Are there any recommended testing techniques that should be used, if so why?

##Item Pass/Fail Criteria##
What are the Completion criteria? This is a critical aspect of any test plan
and should be appropriate to the level of the plan. The goal is to identify whether or not a test
item has passed the test process.
·  At the Unit test level this could be items such as:
·  All test cases completed.
·  A specified percentage of cases completed with a percentage containing some
number of minor defects.
·  Code coverage tool indicates all code covered.
·  At the Master test plan level this could be items such as:
·  All lower level plans completed.
·  A specified number of plans completed without errors and a percentage with
minor defects.
·  This could be an individual test case level criterion or a unit level plan or it can be
general functional requirements for higher level plans.
·  What is the number and severity of defects located?
·  Is it possible to compare this to the total number of defects? This may be impossible,
as some defects are never detected.
·  A defect is something that may cause a failure, and may be acceptable to leave in the
application.
·  A failure is the result of a defect as seen by the User, the system crashes, etc.

##Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements##
Know when to pause in a series of tests or possibly terminate a set of tests. Once testing
is suspended how is it resumed and what are the potential impacts, (i.e. regression tests).
If the number or type of defects reaches a point where the follow on testing has no value,
it makes no sense to continue the test; you are just wasting resources.
·  Specify what constitutes stoppage for a test or series of tests and what is the
acceptable level of defects that will allow the testing to proceed past the defects.
·  Testing after a truly fatal error will generate conditions that may be identified as
defects but are in fact ghost errors caused by the earlier defects that were ignored.
